# GLFW_PROJECT01
### A voxel-based 3d rendering project using OpenGL

Compilation:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd bin
    ./minecraft

Obviously this project is inspired heavily by minecraft.
The purpose is to prove (to myself) my own technical
ability. This is not intended to be a game.
